Objective Gems
==============

All the little things that make my life easier.


What is it?
-----------

Objective Gems is a collection of categories, tools, debugging aids and such for common tasks. It's my "software toolbox".

The project is set up as a framework, but usually I'll just copy whatever stuff I need directly into another project. YMMV.
